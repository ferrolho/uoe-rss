\section{Discussion}

The most successful aspect of the robot was the ability to consistently orientate itself on the center of the arena, and move into a room of interest.\\
The final physical layout of the robot turned out very robust and flexible.

The robot was able to deliver two of the cubes most of the times. Occasionally, it was able to deliver all the three cubes. However, it was not able to deliver a cube from room A to room B, and vice versa.

There is room for improvement regarding the vision of the robot: the algorithm could be enhanced and sped up.\\
Also, the procedure for returning home from room A, and the procedure to go from room A to room C could be tweaked even further in order for the robot to be able to pick the third cube with a greater success rate.
