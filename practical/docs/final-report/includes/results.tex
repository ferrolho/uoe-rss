\subsection{360 scan}

When the robot was placed on the center of the arena, it could always find the entrance to the room it wanted to navigate to, no matter its initial orientation.

When the robot was started, during the initial 360 scan, it turned on itself clockwise, using the IR sensors to sense its surroundings.
